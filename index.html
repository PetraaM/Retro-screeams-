            Some people say the 1990s wasn’t the best time for horror since it marked the end of many of the popular slasher
             franchises from the ‘70s and ‘80s that previous generations grew up on. In those movies’ place, the ‘90s introduced
              way more postmodern teen horrors (following on from Scream). 
              <br><br>
              But there was way more to ‘90s horror than that, 
              and it was an era which deserves a second look. While Scream was revising the slasher model, making it more 
              female-friendly and catering to teen gore hounds who knew all the tricks, The Blair Witch Project ushered in
             a new era of found footage horror, and high-concept marketing. And horror was suddenly becoming more mainstream: 
             Silence of the Lambs became the first and only horror to win the Best Picture Oscar, though The Sixth Sense mustered
             up 6 nominations the following year. Add in some joyful shockers, subversive slashers, sexy thrillers, and more and 
             you have a decade in horror that is absolutely worth your attention.
             I have picked out the best ‘90s horror to feast your eyes on.
